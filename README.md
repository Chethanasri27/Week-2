# Week-2
Traffic Sign Recognition is a deep learning project using CNN and Keras to classify traffic signs from the GTSRB dataset. It achieves 90-95% accuracy through image preprocessing and neural network training, enabling automated traffic sign detection for autonomous vehicles and smart transportation systems.

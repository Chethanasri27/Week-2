## Installation

1. **Clone or download the project:**
   ```bash
   cd traffic-sign-recognition
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download GTSRB dataset:**
   - Visit: https://benchmark.ini.rub.de/
   - Download GTSRB_Final_Training_Images.zip
   - Download GTSRB_Final_Test_Images.zip
   - Extract to `train/` and `test/` folders

4. **Organize data:**
   ```
   train/
   ├── 0/    (Speed limit 20 km/h)
   ├── 1/    (Speed limit 30 km/h)
   ...
   └── 42/   (End of no passing by lorries)
   
   test/
   ├── 0/
   ├── 1/
   ...
   └── 42/
   ```

## Usage

### Training the Model

```bash
python traffic_signs.py
```

The script will:
1. Load and preprocess training/test data
2. Build the CNN model architecture
3. Train for up to 15 epochs with validation split
4. Apply early stopping to prevent overfitting
5. Save the best model to `model/traffic_sign_model.h5`
6. Display test accuracy metrics

### Expected Output

```
Step 1: Loading and preprocessing data...
Training data shape: (39209, 30, 30, 3)
Test data shape: (12630, 30, 30, 3)

```

## Model Architecture

The CNN consists of:
- **3 Convolutional Blocks:** Each with 2 Conv2D layers, BatchNormalization, MaxPooling, and Dropout
- **Filters:** 32 → 64 → 128 channels for progressive feature extraction
- **Fully Connected:** Dense layers (256, 128) with BatchNormalization and Dropout (0.5)
- **Output:** 43 classes with softmax activation
- **Total Parameters:** ~1.5M

## Configuration

Edit `config.py` to customize:

```python
BATCH_SIZE = 32              # Training batch size
EPOCHS = 15                  # Maximum training epochs
VALIDATION_SPLIT = 0.2       # Train/validation split
LEARNING_RATE = 0.001        # Optimizer learning rate
IMG_SIZE = 30                # Image resolution
NUM_CLASSES = 43             # Traffic sign classes
```

# Traffic Sign Recognition

This project implements a deep learning approach for traffic sign classification using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with Keras and TensorFlow. The dataset used is the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB).

## Project Structure

```
traffic-sign-recognition/
├── train/
│   └── [0...42]/              # Subfolders for each sign class, containing images
├── test/
│   └── [0...42]/              # Structured like train for testing
├── meta/
│   └── signnames.csv          # CSV mapping class indices to sign names
├── model/
│   └── traffic_sign_model.h5  # Saved trained model
├── traffic_signs.py           # Main Python training and testing script
├── README.md                  # Project documentation
└── requirements.txt           # Python dependencies
```

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/traffic-sign-recognition.git
   cd traffic-sign-recognition
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies:**
   ```
   pip install tensorflow pillow numpy pandas
   ```

3. **Download the GTSRB dataset** and extract the training and testing images into the `train/` and `test/` folders respectively. Each class should have its own directory named by integer label (e.g., `train/0/`, `train/1/`, ..., `train/42/`). Place `signnames.csv` (mapping class labels to readable names) inside the `meta/` folder.

## Usage

1. **Run the training and evaluation script:**
   ```
   python traffic_signs.py
   ```

2. **Model Output:**
   - The script trains a CNN on the training set, evaluates test accuracy, and saves the trained model as `model/traffic_sign_model.h5`.

## File Descriptions

- **traffic_signs.py:** Main script for data loading, preprocessing, model definition, training, evaluation, and saving the trained model.
- **train/** & **test/**: Directories with images categorized by class label as subfolders.
- **meta/signnames.csv:** Maps class numbers (0-42) to sign names.
- **model/traffic_sign_model.h5:** The saved model file after training.
- **requirements.txt:** List of Python packages required for the project.

## Dataset

- Dataset: German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)
- Website: https://benchmark.ini.rub.de/GTSRB_info.html
- The dataset is organized into class-labeled folders for easy loading.

## Dependencies

- tensorflow
- keras (included in tensorflow)
- numpy
- pandas
- pillow

## Model Architecture

The CNN model includes:
- Convolutional layers with ReLU activation for feature extraction
- MaxPooling layers for dimensionality reduction
- Dense layers for classification
- Output layer with 43 classes (traffic sign categories)

## Example Usage

Sample code for loading data and training the CNN is provided in `traffic_signs.py`. Adjust hyperparameters and preprocessing for improved results as required.

## Performance

- Expected accuracy: 90-95% on the test set
- Training epochs: 10 (adjustable for better convergence)
- Image size: 30x30 pixels

## Future Improvements

- Implement data augmentation for better generalization
- Use transfer learning with pre-trained models (ResNet, VGG)
- Add real-time detection using webcam input
- Deploy as a web application using Flask or Streamlit
